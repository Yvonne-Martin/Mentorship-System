<h2>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 1 AND CHAPTER 2</h2>
<h5>CHARACTERS</h5>
<p>TREVOR NOAH THE AUTHOR/NARRATOR</p>
<p>TREVOR’S MOM</p>

<h4>1. RACISM</h4>
Trevor Noah recalls his youth in the first and second chapters of Born a Crime. He was born in
South Africa in 1984, during a time when black South Africans were divided by apartheid. 
Trevor describes his experiences during the end of apartheid. The many tribes had a long history
of conflict, with the Zulus and Xhosa being the most dominant during apartheid. This is a serious 
issue of ethnic discrimination. Trevor was born to a black mother and a white father which was illegal
and was punishable by imprisonment. 
A similar issue of tribal and ethnic hate is evident in present-day Machakos County, where some tribal 
clans hate each other and cannot intermarry.

<h4>2. CHRISTIANITY</h4>
<p>
    Trevor’s mother was so much into Christianity and she would take the whole family to 
    multiple churches. These churches were the black church, the white church, and the mixed church. 
    Trevor’s mother would never be intimidated by anything so easily since her faith in God was
    unwavering. This is evident in Machakos County where churches are found on every street corner, 
    with each priest preaching about his Faith that will save all from the fires of hell. Each Sunday
    loud blares of speakers are heard from every corner keeping those around awake. Some people attend 
    two different churches each Sunday to pray.
    There is so much similarity between the present world and back then.
