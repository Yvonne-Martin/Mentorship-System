<h2>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 1 AND CHAPTER 2</h2>
<h5>CHARACTERS</h5>
<p>TREVOR NOAH THE AUTHOR/NARRATOR</p>
<p>TREVOR’S MOM</p>

<h4>1. RACISM</h4>
In chapters 1&2 of the story Born a Crime, Trevor Noah describes his childhood life.
He was born in South Africa in the year 1984 during a period when the black South 
Africans were divided into tribes. Trevor Noah narrates how he lived during the years
before and the end of the apartheid system. These tribes had a history of conflict where
the Zulu and the Xhosa were the most dominant tribes during the apartheid period. 
(Apartheid is the legal system for racial segregation). The Zulu were mostly known as
the warriors while the Xhosa were known as the intelligent. This is a major issue of 
racism where some tribes are not allowed to have sexual relationships with another 
tribe. Trevor was born to a black mother and a white father which was illegal and 
would be punishable by the law.  This issue is visible in Machakos County where
people from high social classes are not allowed to interact with people from low 
social classes and also in Ukambani, people from a particular clan are not allowed 
to intermarry with people from a particular clan since it is forbidden and is punishable.

<h4>2. CHRISTIANITY</h4>
<p>
Trevor’s mother was so much into Christianity and she would take the whole family to multiple
churches. She claimed that each church offered something different from the rest of the churches 
where they had some bit of racial demographics. Trevor goes ahead to say that he enjoyed going 
to church to watch the pastor cast demons out of people. These churches were the black church, 
the white church, and the mixed church. Trevor’s mother would never be intimidated by anything 
so easily since her faith in God was unwavering. They would have to attend the church no matter 
what comes their way. On one occasion, their car broke down and they had to board a minibus. 
Trevor kept on insisting that maybe the Lord did not want them to go to church on that particular
day but that could not stop the mother from attending the church services. This is evident in
Machakos County where people believe in going to different churches for spiritual growth. 
Whereas others just go to church for fun to watch when the spiritual teachers are casting demons
out of people.
